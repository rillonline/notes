[Dillon and Rebes](https://wellyourworld.com/) suggests you find a dozen or so recipes you like and then you make them over and over. This is to simplify grocery shopping and meal preparation. I am barely organized to select 12 recipes, but here is my current list:

1. Cowboy Caviar (In their product guide.)
2. Kathy Hester's slow cooker tomato soup.
3. Air fryer garbanzo beans. I typically have this with a salad and often times with the tomato soup.
4. Starchballs from their April visit with Chef AJ. This will be a new recipe for me.
5. Kathy Hester's cheese sauce. I have modified this a bit, using carrots instead of cauliflower, turnips and carrots. I steam the carrots in the Instant Pot. If I have it available, I use Dillon's cheese sauce mix instead of fiddling with adding spices. I usually pour this over pasta.
