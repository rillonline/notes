I have learned more about using Jekyll.

1. Linking: I can link to another post in this repository by its path.

		[link for this post]({% link _posts/2023-04-25-daily-log %})
    
       I have included the markdown code for a link.
	       
       2. I like simple permalinks. I don't need categories or dates appearing except for the post name. (I would eliminate that,too, except that would mean writing a separate permalink for each file and I'm lazy about that. Besides, I might reuse post names from time to time and then the distinctive date would solve any conflicts.
