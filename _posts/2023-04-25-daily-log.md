I have learned more about using Jekyll.

* Linking: I can link to another post in this repository by its path. I need to use a combination of markdown and liquid. Here is an example.
 
 ```markdown ```liquid {% raw %} [link for this post]({% link _posts/2023-04-25-daily-log %}){% endraw %} ``` ``` 
            
       * I like simple permalinks. I don't need categories or dates appearing except for the post name. (I would eliminate that,too, except that would mean writing a separate permalink for each file and I'm lazy about that. Besides, I might reuse post names from time to time and then the distinctive date would solve any conflicts.
