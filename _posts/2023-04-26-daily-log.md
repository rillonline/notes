I am starting to get a handle on my tags. Along with that, I am calling these files I write with my quick notes and thoughts during the day *Daily Log*. They are more for my benefit, helping me sort out a problem and copying notes for formatting and such. Right now they are more focused on getting my blog building the way I would like and populating it with my older entries. 
	
It is tedious to converrt the older posts, but also interesting to read what I thought was important at the time.

I discovered yesterday that `tar` exists on this Windows machine. I have to drop into the terminal to use it. I need `tar` for those times when I want to download the build of my `github pages` site. The file unzips to `artifact.tar` file. 

Right now I need to dive into a recipe or two to have in the fridge. It's a almost empty of meals.

I have been trying to publish this site all day. My line of code in yesterday's log is causing a lot of havoc. Apparently it's not `markdown` that's the problem although properly speaking, I'm using `kramdown`. It's the `liquid` code that's giving me grief. Chat in Bing offered some code which included a fence block which looks specifically like something I would use with Sphinx. The site did not fail, but the link for yesterday's log pointed to this post.

On top of that, nothing links in my archive page.

And speaking of my archive page, all these daily logs I am creating are not distinguished one from another so I have to have a think about that.  This is enough for one day. On to finding an authoritative web page on kramdown and fence blocks tomorrow.
