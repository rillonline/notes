I am starting to get a handle on my tags. Along with that, I am calling these files I write with my quick notes and thoughts during the day *Daily Log*. They are more for my benefit, helping me sort out a problem and copying notes for formatting and such. Right now they are more focused on getting my blog building the way I would like and populating it with my older entries. 
	
It is tedious to converrt the older posts, but also interesting to read what I thought was important at the time.

I discovered yesterday that `tar` exists on this Windows machine. I have to drop into the terminal to use it. I need `tar` for those times when I want to download the build of my `github pages` site. The file unzips to `artifact.tar` file. 

Right now I need to dive into a recipe or two to have in the fridge. It's a almost empty of meals.
