The remote build of my =Jekyll= site on =github= is failing because of a =gems= problem. I don't understand this at all so I have two choices:

1. Dig into help.
2. Go with Jekyll for Designers files.

I'm going back to Minima. In looking at the files I can clone, there are no strange files I do not understand. Let's see if the site can be built.
I like the idea of remote processing but help can be obscure.
