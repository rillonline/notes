The remote build of my =Jekyll= site on =github= is failing because of a =gems= problem. I don't understand this at all so I have two choices:

1. Dig into help.
2. Go with Jekyll for Designers files.

I like the idea of remote processing but help can be obscure.

I am going back to Minima. In reviewing the project files, there are no files for =gems= or anything.  The site builds. I don't like it yet but that's just refinement of the layout files.
