The remote build of my ~Jekyll~ site on ~github~ is failing because of a ~gems~ problem. I don't understand this at all so I have two choices:

1. Dig into help.
2. Go with Jekyll for Designers files.

I like the idea of remote processing but help can be obscure.

I am going back to Minima. In reviewing the project files, there are no files for ~gems~ or anything.  The site builds. I don't like it yet but that's just refinement of the layout files.

Oops. Minima doesn't understand I am using ~markdown~. I guess I have to tell it that. And I need to put a title in Hello World.

My bad. I was using `org` syntax, not markdown. I probably don't need that line in `_config.yml`. Hanging on to this markdown page: [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax]

If I am going to use `categories`, I should figure out how to display the posts in each category. On the other hand, I can just work on posts and worry about that later.
