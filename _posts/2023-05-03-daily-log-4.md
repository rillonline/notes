I haven't been writing this log every day because I have been dropping in and out of debugging this site. I haven't dedicated lots of time so far this week for the project and therefore, I haven't given the time to writing.
	
As far as I can remember, here's what's been happening:

* I wanted an excerpt for my poem. It helps if you spell excerpt properly.
	
* I am having a terrible time with relative links. My archive isn't working properly. I will next investigate the actual `html` of the link. The list of posts have the correctly formed urls, including the base of `github.io` with the repository. The archive page only has a relative link to the post and that doesn't seem to work. I looked up how to append so I have the full url for each post and it looks right in the source. Still, the browser can't find the page.
	
* I have tried to use `paginator` but that's not working at all on the first page. I set the post limit to 5 but that is not being respected either.

* I have discovered there is a big difference between `tag:` and `tags:`. With the singular, a tag can have multiple words. Otherwise, each word becomes a separate tag. I was able to find code to list a published date as well which helps with posts like this one.

That's about it.
